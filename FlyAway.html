      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p> 
       FlyAway was born in 1948 along with the State of Israel, not only as an airborne bridge between the fledgling State and the world, but as an expression of national existence and pride, as the Israeli flag adorning the aircraft's tail proudly appeared in destinations around the world.
       FlyAway grew along with the State, sharing moments of glory and joy promoting the country's growth and expanding its global reach.
       FlyAway continues to grow in step with the country. Although the airline was privatized economically several years ago, its national spirit and commitment to Israel have never wavered.
